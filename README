`cl-faster-input` A project for exploring and improving large files input, parsing, and processing in the Common Lisp applications.

Standard read-line function is being blamed often for being slow and inefficient. Lisp offers a number of alternatives for reading and processing text files and large logs.

This project will explore them all.
